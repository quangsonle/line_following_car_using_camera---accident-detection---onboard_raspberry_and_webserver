# line_following_car_using_camera---accident-detection---onboard_raspberry_http_and_webserver
these are some demonstrations of my childhood works. they may not be impressive buy they are memory

1/ accident detection:

the impact on the helmet represents the accident, mobile phone automatically shows the location of accident

2/ autonomous car line following using camera

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0OejstgCBA&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=abcd

the car tracks but maintains a distance from yellow line using camera (opencv, scikit)

the camera was equipped at high position, negatively affects performance

3/ raspberry communicates to webserver via http to read location 

part1: web server interface
